#SCENARIO:
#My task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the 
#results of four basic arithmetic operations.
var1 = 25.5
var2 = 34.4 
# output the result of addition here
Varible_In_Addition = var1 + var2
print(Varible_In_Addition, )

# output the result of subtraction here
Variable_In_Subtraction = var1 - var2
print("Subtracted Output= ", Variable_In_Subtraction)

# output the result of multiplication here
Variable_In_Multiplication = var1 * var2
print("Multiplied Output= ", Variable_In_Multiplication)

# output the result of division here
Variable_In_Division = var1 / var2
print("Divided Output= ", Variable_In_Division)

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
