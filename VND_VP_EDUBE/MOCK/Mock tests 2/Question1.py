# Question 1
# fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "orange", "banana")
# print("Length of tuple:", len(fruits))
# print("Number of times 'apple' appears:", fruits.count("apple"))
# print("Index of first occurrence of 'cherry':", fruits.index("cherry"))






my_tuple = ("apple","banana","cherry","apple","orange","banana")
