# Objectives:
# becoming familiar with the concept of comments in Python;
# using and not using comments;
# replacing Comments with code;
#     SCENARIO:
# The code in the editor contains comments. Try to improve it: add or remove comments
#  where you find it appropriate( yes, sometimes removing a comment can make the code more readalbe), and change variable names where you think this will imporve code comprehension.

#this program computes the number of seconds in a given number of hours
# this program has been written two days ago

a = 4 # number of hours 
seconds = 6300 # number of seconds in hour

print("Hours: ", a) #printing the number of hours
print("Seconds in Hours: ", a * seconds) # printing the number of seconds in a given number of hours

#here we should also print "Goodbye", but a programmer didn't have time to write any code
print("GoodBye")
# this is the end of the program that computes the number of seconds
