# CODING-IN-PYTHON

Welcome to Tyler’s legacy grind hub for Python mastery.

## 🔧 Structure

- `index.html` — Homepage for the archive
- `modules/` — Python quizzes, drills, and legacy milestones
- `OUT-SOURCED/` — External lessons and resources
- `VND_VP_EDUBE/` — Edube module archive
- `assets/` — Images, icons, and design elements
- `style.css` & `script.js` — Styling and interactivity
- `404.html` — Fallback page for broken routes

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo powers Tyler’s Netlify-deployed museum of Python evolution—grind logs, self-tests, and modular archives.

## 🧠 Legacy Philosophy

Every file is a chapter. Every grind is a milestone.  
This is not just code—it’s a timeline.
